 Configuring RBAC for App Container Managed Identity to Access Azure Storage

 Prerequisites
- Azure CLI installed and logged in
- Necessary permissions to assign roles in your Azure subscription

 Step 1: Identify your Managed Identity

 For Azure Container Apps:
1. Go to the Azure portal
2. Navigate to your Container App
3. In the left menu, click on "Identity"
4. Make sure System assigned identity is turned On
5. Note the Object ID of the Managed Identity

 Step 2: Assign RBAC Role to the Managed Identity

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Storage account
2. In the left menu, click on "Access Control (IAM)"
3. Click on "+ Add" and then "Add role assignment"
4. In the "Role" tab, search for and select "Storage Blob Data Contributor"
5. Click "Next"
6. In the "Members" tab:
   - For Assign access to: choose "Managed identity"
   - Click "+ Select members"
   - In the "Managed identity" dropdown, select "Container App managed identity" or "Virtual machine scale set managed identity" (for AKS)
   - Find and select your app's Managed Identity using the Object ID you noted earlier
   - Click "Select"
7. Click "Review + assign"
8. Review the assignment and click "Assign"

 Step 3: Verify the Role Assignment

1. In the Storage account's "Access Control (IAM)" page
2. Click on "Role assignments"
3. You should see your Managed Identity listed with the "Storage Blob Data Contributor" role

 Step 4: Update Your Application Configuration

1. Remove any connection strings or account keys from your application configuration
2. Ensure your application is using the DefaultAzureCredential for authentication

 Step 5: Test the Configuration

1. Deploy your updated application to the Container App
2. Monitor the application logs to ensure it can successfully connect to and interact with the Storage account

 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Double-check the Role Assignment in the Azure portal
- Verify that the Managed Identity is correctly enabled for your Container App
- Ensure your application is using the correct Storage account name
- Check the application logs for any authentication or access errors

Remember to always follow the principle of least privilege. If your application only needs read access, consider using the "Storage Blob Data Reader" role instead.
